Newtonian n-body 3D gravitational interactions with graphical display (GFA Basic version)
Based on original work dating back to 1986/87 that did 2D calculations and used the Euler 
integration, and entirely rewritten in a 3D model with a choice between Euler and the much 
more accurate Verlet integration, variable integration step, planet collision rules...
